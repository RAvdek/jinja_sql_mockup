# jinja_sql_mockup

Mock application for using Jinja2 to productionize a simple machine learning model.

This is meant to supplement [my blog post](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2017/07/06/one-weird-trick/) on the utility of Jinja2 in writing complex ETL.

To run the application:
```
cd code
python models.py
```
